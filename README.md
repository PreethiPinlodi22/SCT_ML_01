# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective

To implement a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based
on: - Square Footage (GrLivArea) - Number of Bedrooms (BedroomAbvGr) -
Number of Bathrooms (FullBath & HalfBath)

## Dataset

Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## Steps Performed

1.  Data Loading
2.  Feature Selection
3.  Feature Engineering (Total Bathrooms)
4.  Train-Test Split
5.  Model Training using Linear Regression
6.  Model Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2 Score)
7.  Generated Kaggle Submission File

## Tools Used

-   Python
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Scikit-learn

## Output

The model predicts house prices and generates a submission file named:
final_submission.csv
